## How To Use
Look at a spawner with a spawner in your hand to open its settings & info. Right or left click to modify values, shift right or left click to scroll through the menu. 

Any spawner you interact with will be registered. You can prime all registered spawners using `/trigger prime_spawners set` <ticks> This works accross dimensions.

### Options
`/scoreboard players set $range spawner_tweaker <range>`

Default of -1, cubical range to prime spawners in, with negative numbers being infinite (ex. 100 would be a 200 sized cube centered on the player)
`/scoreboard players set $efficient_data spawner_tweaker 1`
1 or 0, default 1. Wheather or not to delete unnecessary data when priming spawners

The pack is low impact so it is fine to keep in published maps.
