Improvements from the previous version:

-Multiple players may now use the system at once (previously, only 1 player could tweak at a time)
-All systems now detects holding down the sneak key rather than if the player is crouched
-You will no longer select or reselect spawners when crouching
-Fixed bug where swapping held spawners would re-select the previous spawner
-Swapping held spawners while looking at a spawner keeps it as selected now
-There is now an unselect sfx
-slightly improved display precision
-Most displays are now interpolated
-Added a trigger to enable/disable tweaker
-Tweaker will show this trigger to anyone that enters creative mode
