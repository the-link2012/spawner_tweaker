Improvements from the previous version (1.21.1):

Features:
-Multiple players may now use the system at once (previously, only 1 player could tweak at a time)
-Added a trigger to enable/disable tweaker
-Modifying delay is now accelerated when you click repeatedly
-Precision of delay modifcation and display is now 1s
-Most displays are now interpolated
-There is now an unselect sfx

QOL:
-All systems now detects holding down the sneak key rather than if the player is crouched
-You will no longer select or reselect spawners when crouching
-Tweaker will show this trigger to anyone that enters creative mode
-Improved the title display so that the only units showing are seconds
-Modifying delay preserves the ratio of the min and max

Bugs:
-Fixed bug where swapping held spawners would re-select the previous spawner
-Swapping held spawners while looking at a spawner keeps it as selected now
-slightly improved display precision
-Fixed a bug where increasing block light from - then removing it did not reset the spawn rule
